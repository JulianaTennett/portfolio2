Our team’s job was to work with restaurant client’s to design custom branded mobile apps used by their customers to collect rewards, view menus and locations, and order ahead. La Centrale was one of my favorite clients to work with during my 6 months at LevelUp, and one of the apps that I got to own from start to finish! <br>
        <br>La Centrale’s branding inspired me from the get-go, and as a brand new, Eately-style dining experience in need of an app for their grand opening, there was a lot of space to interpret and push their branding within their app. The colors, font, and type treatments were all fun to work on, in addition to the fun icon illustrations I got to make!
