With this in mind, we dove head first into conducting user surveys, compiling resources and research into the shopping experience, doing branding exercises with the client, and just wrapping our heads around what Zealery could be.

Not only was it super fun to play with little paper buttons and drop down menus, but collaboration became so much more efficient when we were able to have open discussions as we moved around pieces to compare different solutions.
      <br>
      <br>After our midweek paper wireframing sessions, we would then translate our wireframes to digital screens using Balsamiq. This prototyping program allowed all of our wireframes to remain cohesive before we had set designs implemented.' %}

The layout is smart and easy to use, while the coral adds the pop of friendliness vital to Zealery’s brand.

      <br>I took on the task of designing all of Zealery’s icons in their selected and non-selected states. I loved being able to create icons that felt unique to Zealery while still adhering to iconography that users can recognize easily. All of Zealery’s icons are based on lines, with soft edges that feel friendlier than sharp corners.' %}
