      in outdoor sports, a product that would aid in finding people lost in woods and mountains. Given the huge scope presented by
      the client and the fact that we were the most unathletic team of designers and devs, we decided to extend our standard research
      phase so that we could better understand the target demographics and the varying factors, safety risks, and experiences for a
      range of extreme sports (did you know heli-skiing even existed? I didn’t!) through user surveys and user interviews.<br>
      <br>
      After these three weeks, we realized we needed to narrow TrailTag’s scope from a mobile app and marketing angle targeting all use
      cases across all extreme outdoor sports, to a more narrowed experience that particularly applies to moutain-based group sports
      like hiking, camping, and skiing.'

Member in a group vs. not-yet-joined-a-group, regular state vs. emergency state, emergency state for the one who sent the distress signal vs. users receiving the distress signal, out-of-range users, etc: and all of these divided further into admin view vs. regular user view. Plus you could download maps!<br>
      <br>
      We used paper wireframes (pencils + scissors + little interface component puzzle pieces)  to collaboratively piece together full flows. We then translated our paper wireframes into Balsamiq screens to place into an InVision prototype to update and present to our client at each weekly meeting. We realized quickly that Balsamiq’s limitations as a program made the rapid iteration and duplication of all of our overlapping flows a difficult task to accomplish easily, and retrospectively we agreed that we would have rather used a Sketch file to create low-fi mockups if we had to start all over again!' %}

      par='Another major focus in our high-fi mockups was the navigation we presented users. Based on inspiration from Material design, we decided to create a two-button primary navigation system with a hamburger menu for less important actions. Our first button was a given: we needed to give users the fastest, most obvious way to send a distress signal to the rest of their group with minimal motion/interaction. We implemented a one-touch emergency signal flow: if the user presses the button, the signal is delayed 10 seconds so that the user is able to cancel it (if they pressed it by mistake), but it remains a one-click process for those in distress as the signal automatically sends after 10 seconds if not cancelled.<br>
      <br>
      The second button on the screen gives users access to the group details and messaging component of the TrailTag app. It consists of two parts: the first screen, which is a list of every member in your group that can be used to navigate towards those members on the map. The second screen is a messages feature that works without a cell signal via the bluetooth connection of the TrailTag devices. <br>
      <br>
      The hamburger menu includes all secondary navigation of the app that varies slightly for guides vs. non-guides, including logout, leave group, edit settings, etc.'
