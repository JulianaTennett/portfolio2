With this in mind, we dove head first into conducting user surveys, compiling resources and research into the shopping experience, doing branding exercises with the client, and just wrapping our heads around what Zealery could be.
      <br>
      <br>Our team of five followed an Agile/scrum process, modified for an extended research phase that ran concurrently with our branding phase.' %}

    par1='With three people working on wireframing, our team quickly discovered that the best way for all of us to make UX decisions together was puzzle piecing together paper wireframes, screen by screen. Not only was it super fun to play with little paper buttons and drop down menus, but collaboration became so much more efficient when we were able to have open discussions as we moved around pieces to compare different solutions.
    <br>
    <br>After our midweek paper wireframing sessions, we would then translate our wireframes to digital screens using Balsamiq. This prototyping program allowed all of our wireframes to remain cohesive before we had set designs implemented.'
