Our timeline included phases for research and discovery, branding, ux wireframes, high fidelity design, and the development of the TrailTag mobile app.' %}

        par='Given the huge scope presented by
        the client and the fact that we were the most unathletic team of designers and devs, we decided to extend our standard research
        phase! During this time we sought to better understand the target demographic and varying factors, safety risks, and experiences across a
        wide range of extreme sports (did you know heli-skiing even existed? I didn’t!) through user surveys and user interviews.<br>
        <br>
        After these three weeks, we realized we needed to narrow TrailTag’s scope from a mobile app that targets all use
        cases across all extreme outdoor sports, to a more narrowed experience that applies to a subset of outdoor sports for a better user experience in their MVP. We decided to focus on moutain-based group sports
        like hiking, camping, and skiing.'

        par='Our first weeks of wireframing were all-hands-on-deck as we mapped out, flow-by-flow, each corner of the TrailTag app. We realized quickly how large our UX system would be, given the sheer amount of the overlapping states the app would need to have. States like a member in a group vs. not-yet-joined-a-group, regular use state vs. emergency state, emergency state for the one who sent the distress signal vs. users receiving the distress signal, out-of-range users, etc: and all of these divided further into admin view vs. regular user states. Plus you could download maps!<br>
        <br>
        We used paper wireframes (pencils + scissors + little ui puzzle pieces)  to collaboratively piece together full flows. Once we were all in agreement on the best flow to pursue, we digitized our paper wireframes using Balsamiq and loaded them into an InVision prototype to present to our client at each weekly meeting. Along the way, we realized that Balsamiq’s limitations as a program made the rapid iteration and duplication of all of our overlapping flows a difficult task to accomplish, and retrospectively we agreed that we would have rather used a Sketch file to create low-fi mockups if we had to start all over again!' %}

        par='Another major focus in our high-fi mockups was the navigation we presented users. Based on inspiration from Material design, we decided to create a two-button primary navigation system with a hamburger menu for less important actions. Our first button was a given: we needed to give users the fastest, most obvious way to send a distress signal to the rest of their group with minimal motion/interaction. We implemented a one-touch emergency signal flow: if the user presses the button, the signal is delayed 10 seconds so that the user is able to cancel it (if they pressed it by mistake), but it remains a one-click process for those in distress as the signal automatically sends after 10 seconds if not cancelled.<br>
        <br>
        The second button on the screen gives users access to the group details and messaging component of the TrailTag app. It consists of two parts: the first screen, which is a list of every member in your group that can be used to navigate towards those members on the map. The second screen is a messages feature that works without a cell signal via the bluetooth connection of the TrailTag devices. <br>
        <br>
        The hamburger menu includes all secondary navigation of the app that varies slightly for guides vs. non-guides, including logout, leave group, edit settings, etc.' %}
