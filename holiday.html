        par='This is the creative I designed for New England Conservatorys holiday concert series. The campaign includes a large
        format sign displayed outside of NECs concert hall, a program stuffer inserted into concert programs at all of NECs concerts
        for the month of December, an email graphic, and a web graphic for NECs website. After designing multiple concepts for this
        campaign, I decided on the sweater design because it felt the most attention grabbing, holiday-neutral, and relevant to todays
        holiday fads. A giant sweater on Huntington Ave felt sure to grab the attention of everyone walking by, and attract potential
        audience members to get a closer look.' %}
