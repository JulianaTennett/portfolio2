The concept of the game was inspired by this one time I went on a run in the city and tripped flat onto my face trying to dodge something on the sidewalk. I decided to take that experience and turn it into a fun game of dodging the various things one finds on the sidewalks in Boston. This concept opened the  door to some really awesome illustration opportunities that I was excited to make.' %}

Initially, the main character started out as a static image similar to the obstacles, but after iteration I decided it felt too unnatural and proceeded to have fun making her walk and do a split in the air.' %}
